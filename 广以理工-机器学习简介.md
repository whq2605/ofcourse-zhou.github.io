## A First Introduction to Machine Learning 
Xiang ZHOU
xizhou@cityu.edu.hk


This 3-hour tutorial is a mathematical introduction to (classic) statistical machine learning for the audience in mathematics, science and engineering majors but without statistical  or machine learning background.   The pre-requisits are basic probability and linear algebra.   After the course , the audience are expected to  understand the basic concepts and problems of statistical learning and machine learning in a rigorous and unified approach. Roughly speaking, the main idea of this tutorial is more like 'modelling' process in physics instead of showing a vast number of numerical methods, although the latter is undeniably  important in practice. However, due to the limited time,  any practical  algorithms unfortunately have to be skipped.  It is preferred for the audience  to continue to study (more detailed) numerical algorithms with practical hands-on experiences for some applied problem of their own interest.  The tutorial is split into three sessions:  

 +  Session one:  Bayes learning rule;  generalization error; bias-variande trade off, cross-validation.  This is the most important part since I try to explain the big and unique picture of machine learning. 
 + Session two:  linear and nonlinear regression (Generalized Linear Models), including variable selection (ridege, lasso).  
 + Session three:  classification problem; naive Bayesian;  logistic regression; loss functions in classification. 

Warning: This tutorial is not for those practitioners  who are looking for a quick practical solution to applications.
